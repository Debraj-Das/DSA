* in vim their are three modes of operation
1. command mode or normal mode(esc)
2. insert mode or edit mode(i)
3. visual mode or select mode(v)


this visual mode are different types (mostly 3 types)
1. visual mode (v)
2. visual line mode (shift + v)
3. visual block mode (ctrl + v)

in vim keybinding -> command + count + motion

in insert mode it is just like normal text editor

but it is not like normal text editor , there are some special keybinding in vim for other modes

#1. normal mode -> command mode
command -> action 
    d -> delete
    y -> yank (copy)
    c -> change
    v -> visual mode
    R -> replace mode

count -> number of times to perform action
    3d -> delete 3 lines
    3y -> yank 3 lines
    3c -> change 3 lines
    3v -> visual mode 3 lines

motion -> where to perform action
    j -> down
    k -> up
    h -> left
    l -> right
    w -> word
    b -> back
    e -> end of the word
    etc (there are many more)

some example of command in normal mode
    di" -> delete inside double quote
    ci" -> change inside double quote
    yi" -> yank inside double quote
    vi" -> visual mode inside double quote

Other then this type of motion there are some command. e.g.
gg -> go to top of the file
G -> go to bottom of the file
zz -> center the screen
0 -> go to start of the line
$ -> go to end of the line
^ -> go to first non blank character of the line
f -> find character in the line
F -> find character in the line in backward direction
t -> till character in the line
T -> till character in the line in backward direction
u -> undo
ctrl + r -> redo
. -> repeat last command
/ -> search
n -> next search
N -> previous search
% -> go to matching bracket
* -> search word under cursor
# -> search word under cursor in backward direction
: -> command line mode
    :w -> write
    :q -> quit
    :wq -> write and quit
    :q! -> quit without saving
    :wqa -> write and quit all
    :qa! -> quit all without saving
    :e -> edit
    :e! -> edit without saving
    :e filename -> edit filename
    :e! filename -> edit filename without saving
    :sp filename -> split window horizontally
    :vsp filename -> split window vertically
    :tabe filename -> open file in new tab
    :tabn -> go to next tab
    :tabp -> go to previous tab
    :tabclose -> close current tab
    :tabonly -> close all other tab
    :tabnew -> open new tab
    :tabfirst -> go to first tab
    :tablast -> go to last tab
    :tabmove n -> move current tab to nth position
    :tabdo command -> run command in all tab
    :tab ball -> ope

#2. normal mode -> insert mode
i -> insert before cursor
I -> insert at start of the line
a -> append after cursor
A -> append at end of the line
o -> open new line below current line
O -> open new line above current line
s -> substitute character under cursor
S -> substitute line
c -> change
C -> change till end of the line
r -> replace character under cursor
R -> replace mode
ctrl + o -> insert mode for one command
ctrl + t -> insert mode for one tab
ctrl + w -> delete word before cursor
ctrl + u -> delete line before cursor
ctrl + h -> delete character before cursor (I remove it from my vimrc)

#3. virtual mode -> command mode
d -> delete
y -> yank
c -> change
v -> visual mode
R -> replace mode
and all other command of normal mode
